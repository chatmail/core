//! # SQLite connection pool.
//!
//! The connection pool holds a number of SQLite connections and allows to allocate them.
//! When allocated connection is dropped, underlying connection is returned back to the pool.
//!
//! The pool is organized as a stack. It always allocates the most recently used connection.
//! Each SQLite connection has its own page cache, so allocating recently used connections
//! improves the performance compared to, for example, organizing the pool as a queue
//! and returning the least recently used connection each time.
