# Delta Chat Rust

> Deltachat-core written in Rust 

[![Rust CI](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Installing Rust and Cargo

To download and install the official compiler for the Rust programming language, and the Cargo package manager, run the command in your user environment:

```
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

> On Windows, you may need to also install **Perl** to be able to compile deltachat-core.

## Using the CLI client

Compile and run Delta Chat Core command line utility, using `cargo`:

```
$ RUST_LOG=repl=info cargo run --example repl --features repl -- ~/deltachat-db
```
where ~/deltachat-db is the database file. Delta Chat will create it if it does not exist.

Configure your account (if not already configured):

```
Delta Chat Core is awaiting your commands.
> set addr your@email.org
> set mail_pw yourpassword
> configure
```

Connect to your mail server (if already configured):

```
> connect
```

Create a contact:

```
> addcontact yourfriends@email.org
Command executed successfully.
```

List contacts:

```
> listcontacts
Contact#10: <name unset> <yourfriends@email.org>
Contact#1: Me âˆšâˆš <your@email.org>
```

Create a chat with your friend and send a message:

```
> createchat 10
Single#10 created successfully.
> chat 10
Single#10: yourfriends@email.org [yourfriends@email.org]
> send hi
Message sent.
```

If `yourfriend@email.org` uses DeltaChat, but does not receive message just
sent, it is advisable to check `Spam` folder. It is known that at least
`gmx.com` treat such test messages as spam, unless told otherwise with web
interface.

List messages when inside a chat:

```
> chat
```

For more commands type:

```
> help
```

## Installing libdeltachat system wide

```
$ git clone https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust.git
$ cd deltachat-core-rust
$ cmake -B build . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
$ cmake --build build
$ sudo cmake --install build
```

## Development

```sh
# run tests
$ cargo test --all
# build c-ffi
$ cargo build -p deltachat_ffi --release
```

## Debugging environment variables 

- `DCC_IMAP_DEBUG`: if set IMAP protocol commands and responses will be
  printed

- `DCC_MIME_DEBUG`: if set outgoing and incoming message will be printed 

- `RUST_LOG=repl=info,async_imap=trace,async_smtp=trace`: enable IMAP and
SMTP tracing in addition to info messages.

### Expensive tests

Some tests are expensive and marked with `#[ignore]`, to run these
use the `--ignored` argument to the test binary (not to cargo itself):
```sh
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

## Features

- `vendored`: When using Openssl for TLS, this bundles a vendored version.
- `nightly`: Enable nightly only performance and security related features.

## Language bindings and frontend projects

Language bindings are available for:

- **C** \[[ðŸ“‚ source](./deltachat-ffi) | [ðŸ“š docs](https://c.delta.chat)\]
- **Node.js** \[[ðŸ“‚ source](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-node) | [ðŸ“¦ npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deltachat-node) | [ðŸ“š docs](https://js.delta.chat)\]
- **Python** \[[ðŸ“‚ source](./python) | [ðŸ“¦ pypi](https://pypi.org/project/deltachat) | [ðŸ“š docs](https://py.delta.chat)\]
- **Go** \[[ðŸ“‚ source](https://github.com/deltachat/go-deltachat/)\]
- **Free Pascal** \[[ðŸ“‚ source](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-fp/)\]
- **Java** and **Swift** (contained in the Android/iOS repos)

The following "frontend" projects make use of the Rust-library
or its language bindings:
