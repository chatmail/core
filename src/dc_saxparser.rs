- Whitespace ignored inside tags
- Self-closing tags are issued as open-tag plus close-tag
- CDATA is supoorted; DTA, comments, processing instruction are

- The parser does not care about hierarchy, if needed this can be
  done by the user.
- Input and output strings must be UTF-8 encoded.
- Tag and attribute names are converted to lower case.
- Parsing does not stop on errors; instead errors are recovered.
